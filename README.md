# Portfolio Workspace

This repository now centers on a single Next.js project (`portfolio-site/`) that renders Srinu Duggempudi's portfolio and handles contact submissions via a built-in API route. The legacy Express server has been retired in favour of the new serverless function so the entire stack can be deployed to Vercel without juggling multiple services.

## Projects

- `portfolio-site/` – Next.js + TypeScript app (UI + `/api/contact`)

Refer to each folder’s README for setup and deployment details.
